## Narrative

Sarah, a busy freelance designer, frequently loses track of her daily expenses and dreads the tedious process of manual entry in complicated finance apps. She wants a simple, private solution that enables her to log spending spontaneously—especially on the go, where every second counts. One morning, after buying her daily coffee, Sarah invokes the custom “Add Expense” shortcut on her iPhone. With just a quick voice command and a few taps, her expense is logged and categorized, without ever unlocking the app.

Later, while reviewing her monthly totals, she notices a spike in dining expenses and decides to set a tighter budget. With the app’s clean dashboard and clear charts, she instantly sees where her money is going. Sarah feels empowered to take control of her finances—no complicated setup, no privacy trade-offs, no extraneous features. The simplicity of shortcut integration, combined with robust local analytics, transforms her daily routine and strengthens her trust in the tool. Her improved habits make her a long-term user, while the app’s swift adoption among peers further validates its value proposition.
